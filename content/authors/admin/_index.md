 Jianing Gou is a PhD candidate from Chinese academy of sciences who focuses on **machine learning** and **digital signal processing** in geophysics and geodesy now. His research is directed toward understanding
the **structure of the Earth's deep interior**,
**Geodynamics**,
and interpretation of **Geodetic data anomaly during seismic or other geophysics events**. 

He has strong knowledge of **C/C++, Python, Java, shell** and  **matlab** programming. With these skills, he created quite a few widely used applications and packages in geodesy and geophysics. 

He is also a big fan of **open-source** who interested in algorithms design and computer science technology applied in geoscience.
